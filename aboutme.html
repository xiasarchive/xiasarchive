        <p>Xia Garcia | xiadgarcia@gmaildotcom</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Xia Garcia is a multimedia artist whose work explores themes of the surreal and grotesque found within the subconscious. Intrigued by the frequent nightmares they have experienced since childhood along with the effects of being raised by the internet, Xia’s work exists to fulfill an insatiable itch to share these uncomfortable experiences with others through a combination of as many digital mediums they can get their hands on.
